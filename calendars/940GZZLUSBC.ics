SUMMARY:Interchange Message: SHEPHERD'S BUSH (CENTRAL LINE) STATION: From 
 Wednesday 19 March until late August\, no down escalator. Please take care
  and hold the handrail as you walk down the central staircase\, which has 
 70 steps. This is while we carry out planned maintenance work on one 
 escalator\, to ensure its continued reliability. During this work an 'up' 
 escalator service will be available at all times. To avoid the stairs use 
 these alternative routes\, especially if travelling with children or 
 luggage: For eastbound journeys towards central London: use buses 31 or 
 228 from stop D in the bus station to Holland Park. For westbound journeys
  towards Ealing Broadway or West Ruislip: use bus 228 from stop A in the 
 bus station to White City.
