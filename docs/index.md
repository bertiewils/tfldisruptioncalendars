# TfL Disruption Calendars

Calendars for **planned works** on the London Underground, Overground, DLR and Elizabeth Line.

Use this to see if your station has any upcoming disruptions that clash with your plans.

!!! note

    This is not for, and will not show, live service disruptions. Use TFL Go, Citymapper or something else for that.

## How to use

1. Right-click and copy the link of the station you want a calendar for.
2. In your calendar app, add a new calendar from URL and paste in the link you copied.

!!! important

    You must add the calendar from the URL. Downloading the ics file and importing it will mean you don't get any updates.
