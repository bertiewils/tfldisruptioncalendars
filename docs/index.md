# TfL Disruption Calendars

These are per-station calendars for **planned works** on the London Underground, Overground, DLR and Elizabeth Line.

Use this to see if your station has any upcoming disruptions that clash with your plans.

!!! note

    This is not for, and will not show, live service disruptions. Use TfL Go, Citymapper or something else for that.

## How to use

1. Use the [search](?q=) or the navigation to find the station you are interested in.
2. Click the relevant 'Add to calendar' link.
3. If neither option works for you, you can copy the link and manually add it to your calendar. Be sure you're subscribing to the link to receive any updates.
